			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>
				Hey! My name is Franky Nava and I'm a computer science major. I'm a 3rd year in college at The University of Texas Rio Grande Valley. As of now, I am currently a Web Development Intern at Edinburg Consolidated School District. This multi-million-dollar company has given me the opportunity to advance my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills. It has also provided me with the tools needed to learn two languages, which are C# and SQL as well as learn about a major software tool known as the .NET framework.
			</p>
			<p>
				Moving away from my internship, I'm currently studying to become a Certified AWS Cloud Practitioner. This does not mean that I am only learning about just one cloud service. I am also learning about GCP and Azure to ensure that my knowledge is not just limited to one subject. Along with this, I also recently got my hands on a Raspberry Pi 4 and plan on using it to learn ethical hacking and see what other fun projects I can do to further my computer science knowledge. In the near future, I also do plan on working on more C++ projects since this is my most used language and would love to showcase my mastery of it.
			</p>
			<p>
				You might notice this website change If you visit it often and that is because I am constanlty adding content or trying to increase the minimilistic aesthetic. Thank you for taking the time to look at my website!

				<p>
					<span><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1is-o1p30uxINTkRwyzluFxRc6yh_R7wE/view?usp=sharing">E-Puck Robot</a>  |  <a href="https://github.com/MARSLab-UTRGV/Path-Planning-Obstacle-Avoidance.git">Code</a></span><br>
					This is a project assigned to my partner and I by my research professor. It is a simulated robot, otherwise known as e-puck, that utilizes the Bug1-Algorithm to navigate its way around obstacles and reach a target destination. This will build into a bigger project where the result will be multiple autonomous robots will be able to send each other short-term information that will signal to nearby e-puck's the best path to take towards the set target destination. It finds its way around the obstacles by using its IR sensors.

				<p>
					<span><a href="images/homebrew.PNG">Homebrew App</a>  |  <a href="https://github.com/frankynava22/homebrew.git">Code</a></span><br>
					This is an app that targets individuals who love making their own coffee. It is an app that gives the user the option to pick between two options (for now its only two), input their desired number of cups, and outputs the perfect amount of ingredients to use for their coffee making device they selected. It is developed using the Flutter framework and Dart language. It utilizes a variety of software engineering concepts such as, Test Driven Development, continuous integration, refactoring, feature branches and effective version control.

				</p>

				<p>
					<span><a href="https://ieee-bsb.github.io/IEEE_Brownsville/">IEEE Brownsville Website</a></span><br>
					This is a website i created for the University organization known as IEEE Brownsville. It utilizes git, GitHub, pull requests, code reviews, code maintainability and much more. This is the landmark that turns IEEE Brownsville from a simple organization to a collaborative and professional University organization. The plan is the have current members interested in learning the steps of Software Engineering upload their code and get real time feedback from other individuals experienced in Web Development.</p>

				<p>
					<span><a href="https://www.ecisd.us/apps/pages/technology">ECISD Website</a></span><br>
					This is a multi-million-dollar companies website who I am in charge of maintaining in my Web Development internship. I modify pages using a content management system and front-end code such as HTML, CSS, JS and JQuery. I work with cross functional teams and am a resource for any and all website help across 30+ school campuses.
				</p>

				<p>
					<span><a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ch51PqkylVET2ofThKNviR2jpu6G0PoNMy6D4nYv6KA/edit?usp=sharing">Nissan Design Challenge</a></span><br>
					From over 100 applicants, 25 individuals were selected to present an idea in front of 3 Nissan Design judges that were in charge of Manufacturing, Cost Management, and Quality. Our job as a team was to propose an idea that would improve sustainability in electric vehicles while keeping into account the cost of manufacturing and the impact on present EV models. As a team we decided on replacing the current (LIB) separators located within the cars lithium ion batteries to a mixture of two phase changing materials, Paraffin Wax and Polyacrylonitrile.
				</p>

				<p>
					<span><a href="https://frankynava22.github.io/calculator/">JS Calculator</a> </span><br>
					This is an online calculator I developed using Javascript as the main language. It utilizes multiple functions to correctly calculate the correct output of two numbers and the selected operation. It is a simple website that was used to test my Javascript knowledge.

			<h2> Experience </h2>

				<p> <span>UTRGV - Autonomous Robotics Research Assistant</span> <br> 
					Actively engaged in collaborative research, my team and I are delving deep into the practical application of Python programming to enhance autonomous robot behavior. We've been implementing simulations in virtual environments, aiming to predict and refine robotic behaviors before they're exhibited in the real world. As we transition from these virtual simulations, we harness the power of ROS and directly apply controller code to real-world design applications. Central to our efforts are advanced techniques such as foraging algorithms, path planning, and obstacle avoidance, all of which work in tandem to optimize robotic response.
				</p>

				<p> <span>ECISD Web Development Intern</span> <br> 
					As a web development intern, I oversee managing over 30+ school websites, along with our main district webpage, using a content management system. Things such as Broken Links, IFrame Issues, and Header Issues are some common errors that I must manage daily. This, of course, is not an individual task, but instead a team effort. With the help of the technology contacts at each campus, I am not only able to guide them in fixing the error, but I am given the opportunity to build relationships with everyone to ensure that they feel comfortable and can rely on me to assist them whenever it is needed. Moving on, besides improving on my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills, I am given the chance to expand my knowledge in two new languages, which are C# and SQL, and can learn about a major software application known as .NET Framework. I have big plans in this internship, and I plan on expanding my knowledge farther then I ever have.
				</p>

				<p> 
					<span>UTRGV IT Support</span> <br> 
					As an IT Specialist, I utilized a variety of software on the daily basis. I used Linux, more specifically Ubuntu Linux, to erase hard drives from old computers to prep them to be reimaged. Acronis and Ghost64 were two 3rd party software’s that I became very familiar with. Acronis allowed me to clone or capture and image of any computer using a hard drive and a USB, which is where Acronis was found. Then with that captured image in the hard drive, I could either push it to another computer, or keep it as backup incase the computer that was just cloned, fails. Ghost64 allowed me to reimage a computer using just a USB. In that USB there was essentially dozens of images of podiums and lab computers. Of course, there is much more than just plugging it in and using it, but for simplicity I will not go into detail. My days consisted of checking power supplies, fixing printers, Running System Rescue, setting up BIOS, using scripts to perform a variety of tasks and much, much more, but I cannot fit that all here. This job gave me the skills to feel comfortable when working with the hardware portions of computers.
				</p>

				<p> 
					<span>BestBuy Sales Specialist</span> <br> 
					This was the first job that really got me into computers. In this job I was assigned to two areas, Home Theatre and Computers. I spent almost all my time in computers learning about simple things such as how RAM affects computers, how CPU’s work, the difference in the operating system for each brand, and much more. Of course, as my old job title suggests, I was in charge of selling. This is where I truly learned just how important building bonds with customers and coworkers is. I learned how to approach the different customers that walked in, how to build relationships with each customer so that they could come back and ask for me and have a positive experience with BestBuy, how to collaborate with all sorts of coworkers and much more. I did not look at my job title and think that my sole purpose is to just hit my quota for the day and leave. My job was to learn how to effectively communicate with different customers to ensure that their experience with me was above their expectations, even if they left with nothing. This world is nothing but communication, and this job gave met the chance to perfect it. With over 25+ positive costumer service reviews and 4 recommendations from customers, I really made sure that my time here was worth it.
