				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>
					My name is <strong>Franky Nava</strong>, and I'm currently pursuing a <strong>Bachelor's degree in Computer Science</strong> from The University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, now in my senior year.
				</p>
				<p>
					Presently, I am serving as a <strong>Data Analyst Intern</strong> at Dallas County Health and Human Services. Here, my primary responsibilities encompass <strong>data cleansing</strong> of government datasets and leveraging advanced visualization tools like <strong>PowerBi</strong>. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Simultaneously, I am engaged as a <strong>Research Assistant</strong> in the domain of <strong>Multiple Autonomous Robot Systems</strong> (often referred to as Swarm Robotics) at my university. This research initiative is generously supported by the <strong>Department of Homeland Security</strong>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Furthermore, I hold an internship designation as a <strong>Web Master</strong> with Edinburg Consolidated School District.
				</p>
				<p>
					I am profoundly grateful for the myriad of opportunities that have come my way, and I owe my deepest gratitude to God for the blessings and guidance He continues to bestow upon me.
				</p>
				<p>
					Transitioning from my professional experience, I am currently immersed in my journey to attain the <strong>Certified AWS Cloud Practitioner</strong> credential. In addition, I recently acquired a <strong>Raspberry Pi 4</strong>, an exciting platform that I intend to leverage for ethical hacking.
				</p>
				<p>
					On the programming front, I anticipate diving deeper into <strong>C++</strong>—a language I frequently employ.

						<p>This is a current project that involves recreated the arcade game known as Asteroids using C++ at the command line terminal and a basic game engine. It will involve letting the user move around with the keyboard and shooting asteroids, progressively getting harder and infinitely scaling. The video that I am showing is how it looks like currently.</p>

						</h3>
						<p>This is a project assigned to my partner and I by my research professor. It is a simulated robot, known as e-puck, that utilizes the Bug1-Algorithm to navigate its way around obstacles and reach a target destination. This builds into a larger project where multiple autonomous robots will share short-term information, signaling to nearby e-pucks the optimal path towards the target destination. The robot navigates using bug0 algorithm and returns back to its initial location.</p>

						<p>This app targets coffee enthusiasts who prefer crafting their own brews. It allows users to select from two options (currently), input their desired cup count, and then provides the precise ingredient measurements for their chosen brewing method. Developed using the Flutter framework and Dart language, the app incorporates various software engineering concepts such as Test Driven Development, continuous integration, refactoring, feature branches, and effective version control.</p>

						<p>From a pool of 100 applicants, 25 were chosen to pitch ideas to three Nissan Design judges overseeing Manufacturing, Cost Management, and Quality. Our team was tasked with suggesting an innovation that would enhance electric vehicle sustainability while considering manufacturing costs and the implications for current EV models. We proposed replacing the existing LIB separators within lithium-ion batteries with a blend of two phase-changing materials: Paraffin Wax and Polyacrylonitrile.</p>

					<span class="experience-title">UT Health (Data Analyst Intern)</span>
					<br> 
					At UT Health, I utilized various software tools to efficiently gather and preprocess community data, ensuring its accuracy and reliability for subsequent analytics. By organizing this raw data into impactful visualizations, I provided valuable insights that aided not only UT Health in its data-driven decision-making processes but also its stakeholders. Moreover, I streamlined the data processing pipeline. This enhancement not only facilitated more efficient analytics but also ensured that the data was both sufficient and relevant for specific tasks.

					<span class="experience-title">Multiple Autonomous Robot Systems (Research Assistant)</span>
					<br> 
					Actively engaged in collaborative research, my team and I are delving deep into the practical application of Python programming to enhance autonomous robot behavior. We've been implementing simulations in virtual environments, aiming to predict and refine robotic behaviors before they're exhibited in the real world. As we transition from these virtual simulations, we harness the power of ROS and directly apply controller code to real-world design applications. Central to our efforts are advanced techniques such as foraging algorithms, path planning, and obstacle avoidance, all of which work in tandem to optimize robotic response.

					<span class="experience-title">ECISD (Web Master Intern)</span>
					<br> 
					As a web development intern, I oversee managing over 30+ school websites, along with our main district webpage, using a content management system. Things such as Broken Links, IFrame Issues, and Header Issues are some common errors that I must manage daily. This, of course, is not an individual task, but instead a team effort. With the help of the technology contacts at each campus, I am not only able to guide them in fixing the error, but I am given the opportunity to build relationships with everyone to ensure that they feel comfortable and can rely on me to assist them whenever it is needed. Moving on, besides improving on my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills, I am given the chance to expand my knowledge in two new languages, which are C# and SQL, and can learn about a major software application known as .NET Framework. I have big plans in this internship, and I plan on expanding my knowledge farther then I ever have.

				<p> 
					<span class="experience-title">UTRGV (IT Support)</span>
					<br> 
					As an IT Specialist, I utilized a variety of software on the daily basis. I used Linux, more specifically Ubuntu Linux, to erase hard drives from old computers to prep them to be reimaged. Acronis and Ghost64 were two 3rd party software’s that I became very familiar with. Acronis allowed me to clone or capture and image of any computer using a hard drive and a USB, which is where Acronis was found. Then with that captured image in the hard drive, I could either push it to another computer, or keep it as backup incase the computer that was just cloned, fails. Ghost64 allowed me to reimage a computer using just a USB. In that USB there was essentially dozens of images of podiums and lab computers. Of course, there is much more than just plugging it in and using it, but for simplicity I will not go into detail. My days consisted of checking power supplies, fixing printers, Running System Rescue, setting up BIOS, using scripts to perform a variety of tasks and much, much more, but I cannot fit that all here. This job gave me the skills to feel comfortable when working with the hardware portions of computers.
